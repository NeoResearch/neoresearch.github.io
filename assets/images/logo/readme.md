# **NeoResearch logo**

NeoResearch has been looking for redesigning its logo, in order to improve and harmonize it in accordance with better designing standards.
In a first moment, different members of *NEO design Discord channel* suggested some innovative designs.
Thus, everyone was invited to share ideas and inspirations for the new logo.
Around 29th November we have decided about our definetive [logo](https://neoresearch.io/logo/neoresearch-logo-journey/).

However, any designer should fell to PR their ideas and contributions.
The steps that should e followed for the inclusion of logo proposals in this repository are:

## **Guidelines for including your logo:**
1. Clone this repository (or directly use the GitHub Pull Request system);
2. Create a folder inside `logo` with the name of your `*logo-title*`;
3. Include a `readme.md` with:
  - Authors;
  - Logo inspiration;
  - New reward address (nice insights might receive some rewards);
  - License should be MIT or equivalent.
4. Include any logo format you want, such as **.svg format + other ones (.jpeg; .png)**;
