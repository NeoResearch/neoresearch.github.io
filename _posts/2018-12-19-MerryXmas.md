We would like to thanks [Gemcut.io team](http://gemcut.io/) for this nice design.

In addition, we would like to highlight the great efforts done by the community in order to improve
NEO dBFT towards a higher level.
In particular, we would like to emphasize the great job that NeoResearch team
did during these last months by motivating [Pull Request 426](https://github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/426), P2P improvements on the way nodes could recover after long delays or networks fail, NEO-VM and its possible speed-ups.

We wish everyone a Merry Christmas with Scientific transformation in all our Ecosystem, such
as our adorable butterfly.
