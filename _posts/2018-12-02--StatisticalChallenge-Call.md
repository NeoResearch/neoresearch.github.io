## Challenge brief description

Following our [pre-announce](/challenges/PreAnnounce-StatisticalChallenge/) of this challenge,
this competition will be limited to award concise statistical reports, focused on Neo blockchain bottlenecks and interesting time aspects.
However, participants are encouraged to go further.
We do not discard the possibility of increasing the reward for outstanding findings, in particular,
according to the acceptance of NGD and Neo Council towards the contributions, such as the [Bounty Program](https://neo.org/blog/details/4105).

NeoResearch team will do their best to ensure that a wide public can participate in the competition.
A didactic and and simple guidelines is provided in order to motivate everyone to try out their scientific nature.

This statistical and optimization competition is going to award 600 NEO.

### Competition infrastructure and guidelines

Basically, the competition will involve:

* Time to be creative:
  - Participants are encouraged to use [NeoCompiler Eco(system)](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neocompiler-eco) for playing with proof-of-bullets tests and report their finding. However, other types of analyses are welcomed:
    - The three best reports will be awarded with 250, 100 and 50 NEO, respectively;
    - Up to 20 reports that contains concise information will be rewarded with, at least, 10 NEO;
    - Outstanding incentives and other prizes may also be awarded.
  - Modification to the Neo clients can be done by using the scripts available at [neo-tests repository](https://github.com/NeoResearch/neo-tests/tree/master/docker-build-neo-cli);
  - We also encourage the use of other platforms for assisting the findings of your statistical analyses, such as [neo-local](https://github.com/CityOfZion/neo-local) or [neo-one](https://github.com/neo-one-suite/neo-one);
  - Our team will revise all entries and, if necessary, forward crossed experiments to be replicated by participants;
  - The call focused on the following topics (but not limited to):
      - Statistics about the Neo-VM, opcode executions;
      - Statistics about nodes syncing times;
      - Detailed information about consensus times and bottlenecks;
      - Statistics about mempool data sharing as well as other p2p messages;
      - Statistics related Neo blockchain storage data;
      - Statistics about the use of current smart contracts;
      - Among others.

Participants are encouraged to release their researching spirit, being critic and, at the same time, ["blinded"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment).
