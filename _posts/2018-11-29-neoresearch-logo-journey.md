Around February 16th, 2018, NeoResearch member proposed a logo with the following idea:

* Blue represents the Earth and clean technologies;

* Red represents Mars and communication protocols for interplanetary distances, embracing Quantum technologies;

* Green represents Neo and the Smart Economy;

* The Leaf represents "The Blockchain of Life", including all life forms;

* Finally, black represents the struggle to bring enlightenment and vision to adopt these groundbreaking and society changing technologies.

# The evolution and contributions

The necessity for improving this logo was clear and soon several members of the NEO community started to suggest different types of ideas on Discord.

A guidelines for logo contributions was [opened](/assets/images/logo/readme.md) until we could find the final design.

After great insights from @Edge, a logo with Pau Brasil was firstly design.

Following this design, [http://gemcut.io/](http://gemcut.io/) team magnificently created a butterfly with Pau Brasil leaves surround of an art of Golden proportions, guided by the mastermind of @Alex.

Around November 29th, 2018, we are able to finally reach the paths for our future logo.
