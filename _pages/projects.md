NeoResearch team focus on cutting-edge projects for the Neo Blockchain, covering from end-users didactic applications to contributions into state-of-the-art concepts involved in the Neo-VM and Blockchain Consensus and Communication.


## Research directions

NeoResearch team has been mainly focusing on: NeoCompiler Eco Improvements; Consensus optimizations strategies and High-performance Neo-VM.

While some brief details about projects conducted/assisted by NeoResearch members can be seen here,
other contributions are directed submitted on [neo-project core github](https://github.com/neo-project), as well as in specific discussions sessions on Discord, Reddit and other academic events or meetups.

In order to achieve our goals of making Neo ecosystem a top scientifically engaged Blockchain, NeoResearch tries to engage members and contributors to focus on cutting-edge and precise contributions to the Neo Core libraries.
In this sense, we encourage members to work in partnership with [Neo Core developers](https://github.com/orgs/neo-project/people), as well as connected with other developers communities, such as: [City Of Zion](http://cityofzion.io/), [NewEconoLabs](https://nel.group/), [AmazoNeo](https://amazoneo.la/) and [SPCC Neo](https://nspcc.ru/).

## Key projects

* [NeoCompiler Eco](https://neocompiler.io/), an ecosystem of Compiers RPC servers and several tools for testing and analyzing smart contracts;
